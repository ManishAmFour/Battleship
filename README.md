I've developed the classic Battleship game, a strategic guessing game where players aim to sink their opponent's hidden fleet. The game involves a grid-based board where ships are placed either horizontally or vertically. Players take turns guessing coordinates to hit and eventually sink all enemy ships. My version includes interactive visuals, turn-based logic, and a simple yet engaging user interface.
